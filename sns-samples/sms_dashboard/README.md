[sms_dashboard.py](sms_dashboard.py.py) will provide you additional insights on your SMS usage for a month pulling data from SMS Usage Reports stored in Amazon S3. Once enable, this script will pull a month's data (defaults to current month), extracts the **total parts**, **message types**, and the **mobile endpoint** where SMS were sent; and displays in a tablular dashboard using PrettyTable (can be added as a Lambda layer from [here](/lambda-layer/prettyTable.zip)).

By default, this will use the current aws region, month and year, but can be overiden to use specific month/year by changing:
```
# ==================
# REGION_NAME = 'us-east-1'
# YEAR = '2020'
# MONTH = '04'
# ==================
```

If you don't want to display any of the following dashboard, simply comment the lines:

```
print(f"SMS Dashboard for {MONTH}/{YEAR}")
print(DASH_TABLE)
print("\n")
print(COUNTRY_TABLE)
print("\n")
print(PHONE_NUMBER_TABLE)
```
